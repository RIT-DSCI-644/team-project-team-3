# Project Description
Our team plans to analyze the retweets of Trump and Clinton by Congress to explore if members of Congress retweet their 
candidateâ€™s tweets with positive or negative sentiment. 
We will also analyse how Congressmen welcome their candidates tweets by analyzing their retweets. 
This result will help us understand how supportive or critical Congress members are of their respective candidates. 
Reception of each tweet and their reaction is a consistent process or experiences a spikes at different intervals of 
time will also be analyzed. This will help us understand whether the members of Congress are really in sync and 
touch with their candidates through social media and share their opinion on day to day topics and not on popular topics 
which have a tendency to become controversial. We will apply machine learning techniques, such as a bag-of-words model to help us do this.
